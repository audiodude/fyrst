Web app for finding and displaying any user's first tweet

This was a project that I started and worked on for a little while, until I realized that the Twitter
REST API only returns 3200 of the most recent tweets for requests to /statuses/user_timeline. Around
the same time, I learned that Twitter did an app like this for their 8th birthday 3 months ago:

So, this is basically closed. But not a bad demo app for how to do basic AJAX in Flask.
